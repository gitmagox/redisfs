  *  We could probably cache more.

  *  We could certainly compress the file contents - pro being that
    network round-trip time will be reduced.

  *  Performance could be improved by either batching up operations, or
    going ASYNC.  (Caveat: We use a global mutex because FUSE doesn't play
    so well with ASYNC stuffs.  Investigate.)

  *  Break out the code in src/ into FUSE-specific & REDIS-Specific parts.
     Add matching test cases.
